            <description><![CDATA[Zero signals about AI safety, alignment, governance, or responsible AI from any trust tier this cycle. Reddit's 60 signals span LocalLLaMA, singularity, OpenAI, and MachineLearning — all capabilities-focused. TechMeme's 13 editor-curated stories: zero safety framing. This isn't 'safety is quiet' — it's structurally gone from the conversation during active capabilities discussion. If you track safety-capabilities balance as a leading indicator, the ratio is currently undefined.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[LocalLLaMA generated 21 signals vs r/OpenAI's 16, with active help/question threads indicating new self-hosters onboarding, not just enthusiasts. Simon Willison's expert feed is 100% open-source LLM tooling this cycle — zero proprietary coverage. Expert-crowd convergence on open-weight models is strengthening while proprietary discussion is increasingly question-and-complaint shaped. If you're building agent infrastructure, open-weight deployment gravity is measurably increasing.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[r/MachineLearning 'project' tag went from 1 to 4 signals — a 300% velocity increase. Simultaneously, tutorial/guide content appeared for the first time this cycle. This is a paper-to-implementation phase transition: the community is building, not just reading. For researchers, this means your papers are being turned into tools faster — check if your work is being correctly implemented or misrepresented in these projects.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[OpenAI News produced exactly 1 signal (tagged 'longer' — likely a blog post) while r/OpenAI generated 16 community signals dominated by discussion and question threads. The community-to-primary signal ratio is 16:1. Historically, quiet primary channels paired with loud community speculation precede product announcements or pricing changes. Monitor for GPT-5 or o4 release signals in the next 1-2 cycles.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[TechMeme's 13 signals are tagged 'business' — every single one. Reddit's signals are tagged 'discussion', 'question', 'project'. The editor tier sees AI through a market/enterprise lens while the developer crowd is in pure build mode. When business narrative and technical reality diverge this cleanly, corrections follow — either products underdeliver on hype or technical capabilities outrun business models. Watch for which side adjusts.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[r/singularity produced 14 signals with a new 'meme' tag (velocity +100% from zero). Meme production is a reliable lagging indicator of mainstream saturation — discourse moves from 'is this real?' to cultural furniture. The singularity/AGI narrative may be peaking in the current hype cycle. Contrarian signal: what the memes mock often points to where the next real development hides.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Despite DeepSeek R1's disruption and Qwen establishing a strong open-weight position, zero signals reference Chinese-origin models across all six panel sources. Either the initial shock has been absorbed and normalized (models used without discussion), or there's a geographic attention bias in English-language feeds. If you're benchmarking open-weight: check Qwen and DeepSeek release pages directly — this panel may be blind to that cadence.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Question/help tags spiked +100% from zero across multiple subreddits (r/OpenAI 3 questions, r/LocalLLaMA 5 help threads), with tutorial content also appearing for the first time. This suggests a new practitioner cohort entering — likely triggered by recent tool releases or corporate AI mandates. Quality of community answers during onboarding waves creates persistent misconceptions that propagate for months.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Neither HN Digest (5 developer-focused signals) nor Simon Willison (4 LLM-tools signals) mentioned MCP, agent frameworks, or tool-use infrastructure. Given MCP's rapid 2025 adoption and agent tooling in production, the absence from expert and crowd tiers suggests infrastructure-to-plumbing transition — it's no longer news, it's assumed. If you're still evaluating agent frameworks, the window for differentiated positioning is closing.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Both 'startups' and 'valuations' appeared as new velocity tags this cycle (+100% from zero), while TechMeme maintained all-business framing. Financial discussion bleeding from editor tier into technical communities is a phase indicator — when ML practitioners discuss money, it signals either a funding wave or growing bubble anxiety. Cross-tier convergence on business topics from both editor and raw tiers is worth tracking as a market sentiment proxy.]]></description>
