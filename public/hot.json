      "summary": "OpenAI signals jumped +13,600% (6→822) but NONE of the signal groups across any source mention safety, alignment, or responsible AI. During a period of massive capability announcements from OpenAI, the complete absence of safety discourse across all 5 sources — including Reddit's r/singularity and r/MachineLearning where safety debates typically surface — suggests either safety framing has been fully absorbed into product marketing or the research community has stopped treating safety as a distinct concern. Monitor whether this is permanent narrative death or temporary displacement.",

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "summary": "Across 52 signals from 5 sources with different biases, there is zero mention of Anthropic, Claude, or any Anthropic product. OpenAI occupies 7 of 22 Reddit signal groups, dominates Google Trends velocity, yet Anthropic is invisible. For a company that was neck-and-neck on capability benchmarks in mid-2025 with Claude Opus 4, this absence from the discourse is notable. Either Anthropic is in a pre-launch quiet period, or OpenAI has successfully captured the entire narrative window. Watch for an Anthropic announcement that could snap attention back.",
