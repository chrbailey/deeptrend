Academic multi-agent research isn't tracking industry product activity — current agent frameworks are engineering integrations, not research breakthroughs. If you're evaluating agent architectures, look at the PL and systems literature rather than cs.MA; the real work is happening in tooling repos, not research papers.",

      "summary": "Zero cs.CY (computers & society) signals across all feeds, no safety-specific topics from any source, despite EU AI Act prohibited practices provisions being actively enforced since Feb 2025 and broader obligations phasing in now. Safety discourse has either migrated entirely to private governance channels and compliance consultancies, or genuinely cooled during a capabilities-dominated period. Check whether your safety-adjacent colleagues have pivoted to compliance work — the research-to-regulation pipeline may have absorbed the talent.",
