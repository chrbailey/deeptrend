      "summary": "Simon Willison, Import AI, AlphaSignal, Last Week in AI, Ahead of AI, MarkTechPost, OpenAI News, Google Research, and BAIR all produced zero signals this cycle. Only 4 of 5 panel tiers are active (raw, crowd, editor, algorithm — no expert, no primary). When crowd and raw tiers are noisy but experts are silent, the discourse is unfiltered — there's no editorial layer interpreting events. Either verify feeds aren't broken, or note that this window's signals lack the expert curation that makes convergence meaningful. Treat all insights this cycle with lower confidence until expert commentary catches up.",

      "confidence": 0.73,
      "summary": "Zero safety, alignment, or governance signals across any tier, while 'deployed' (+100% from zero) and 'agency' (+100% from zero) both entered velocity simultaneously. Historically, deployment acceleration without concurrent safety discussion precedes regulatory or incident-driven corrections. The EU AI Act general-purpose AI obligations hit Aug 2025 — if agents are being deployed at scale without safety discourse, either compliance is being treated as solved (unlikely) or practitioners have decoupled safety from deployment conversations. If you're shipping agent systems, this gap is your risk surface.",
