Only 4 of 5 panel tiers are active (raw, crowd, editor, algorithm — no expert, no primary). When crowd and raw tiers are noisy but experts are silent, the discourse is unfiltered — there's no editorial layer interpreting events. Either verify feeds aren't broken, or note that this window's signals lack the expert curation that makes convergence meaningful. Treat all insights this cycle with lower confidence until expert commentary catches up.",

If this is crossing from functional programming niche into trending, developers may be adopting it for agent pipeline reliability.
