These are internal identifiers leaking into topic extraction, not meaningful velocity signals. The velocity detection system is generating false positives and masking genuine acceleration patterns. Pipeline fix: verify that topic slugs are extracted from signal content/metadata before velocity calculations, not from source_ids or row numbers.",

This isn't proportional to research output — it reflects a content marketing strategy that floods feed-based discovery systems. Their 'learning' tag (16 signals) confirms tutorial/educational content inflating counts. Any intelligence pipeline consuming these feeds uncritically will be OpenAI-narrative-biased by default. Normalize by source before aggregating, or cap per-source signal counts.",
