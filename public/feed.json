During a period of massive capability announcements from OpenAI, the complete absence of safety discourse across all 5 sources — including Reddit's r/singularity and r/MachineLearning where safety debates typically surface — suggests either safety framing has been fully absorbed into product marketing or the research community has stopped treating safety as a distinct concern. Monitor whether this is permanent narrative death or temporary displacement.",

OpenAI occupies 7 of 22 Reddit signal groups, dominates Google Trends velocity, yet Anthropic is invisible. For a company that was neck-and-neck on capability benchmarks in mid-2025 with Claude Opus 4, this absence from the discourse is notable. Either Anthropic is in a pre-launch quiet period, or OpenAI has successfully captured the entire narrative window. Watch for an Anthropic announcement that could snap attention back.",

This is a characteristic Willison pattern: when everyone else chases announcements, he focuses on what you can actually build. His silence on the OpenAI surge (only 1 signal total) suggests the announcements may be less technically significant than the volume implies. If Willison isn't writing about it, ask whether the OpenAI velocity is news or noise.",

LocalLLaMA (5 signals) is active but tagged 'discussion' and 'resources' — not new model excitement. The open-source AI narrative appears to have stalled. This matters because if the discourse has shifted entirely to closed-model providers (OpenAI dominance in these signals), it may indicate the open-weight competitive window is perceived as closing.

If you're building on video generation APIs, the competitive window for differentiation is closing as this commoditizes.",
