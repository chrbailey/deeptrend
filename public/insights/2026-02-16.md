8 arXiv cs.CL papers represent the second-largest arxiv category, with cross-listings to cs.AI (3) and an unusual cond-mat.dis-nn (disordered systems) crossover, suggesting statistical physics approaches to language model analysis. This theoretical depth isn't yet reflected in Reddit discussion.

## p1: Agent-vs-Human: No Moltbook Signal

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.65

Moltbook returned zero signals this window while Reddit and arXiv are highly active. This is either a scraping issue, an API outage, or genuine agent quiescence. If agents aren't tracking what humans are buzzing about, that gap itself is significant — human excitement may be outpacing agent analysis.

## p1: OpenAI Community Activity

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.74

r/OpenAI produced 26 signals with 'news' (4) and 'discussion' (10) tags, suggesting active product/announcement discussion.
