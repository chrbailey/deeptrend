## p0: Expert tier blackout — 5 of 6 expert sources returned zero signals

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.92 | **Sources:** 2

Import AI, AlphaSignal, Last Week in AI, Ahead of AI all absent this cycle. Only MarkTechPost (2 signals) and Simon Willison (1 signal) reported. Combined with missing GitHub Trending (algorithm), Google Research, and BAIR (primary), 10 of 18 configured sources produced nothing — the pipeline is running at 44% source coverage. Convergence analysis is unreliable when most trust tiers are effectively offline. Action: audit RSS feed health for all zero-signal sources before the next analysis cycle; do not trust cross-tier convergence scores until coverage is restored.

## p0: Velocity calculation producing false positives from 0→1 transitions

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.88 | **Sources:** 1

Every hot topic this cycle except 'sources' is a 0→1 transition scored as +100% velocity. 'Colorectal', 'cancer', 'vaccine', 'encouraging' — these are single signals masquerading as surges due to division-by-near-zero math. The only genuine velocity signal is 'sources' (1→3, +200%), and even that is 3 absolute signals. This means the velocity system is currently generating noise, not intelligence. Action: consider a minimum-signal-count threshold (e.g., velocity only calculated when base count ≥ 3) to prevent single-signal false positives from dominating the hot topics list.

## p1: Reddit raw volume (174 signals) overwhelming curated tiers (41 signals combined)

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.82 | **Sources:** 1

Reddit alone produced 37% of all signals, with LocalLLaMA (53) outweighing all expert + primary + editor sources combined. The LLM Counsel model weights by trust tier, but when raw-tier input is 4x the volume of curated tiers, convergence scoring may be skewed toward topics that happen to appear in both Reddit AND one other source — creating artificial convergence. This is a methodological risk, not a content insight. Action: consider per-tier signal normalization before convergence calculation, or cap raw-tier contribution to prevent volume-driven priority inflation.

## p1: Colorectal cancer vaccine signal in AI-configured feeds

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.75 | **Sources:** 1

A single Google Trends signal about colorectal cancer vaccines appeared in a pipeline configured for AI/tech intelligence. While the velocity math inflated it to +100%, the actual signal is one data point. Its presence reveals a scoping issue: the Google Trends scraper isn't topic-filtered, so any mainstream news cycle (mRNA vaccine trial results, in this case) leaks into the AI signal corpus. Action: add topic filtering to the Google Trends ingestion endpoint, or tag non-AI signals for exclusion from the analysis prompt.

## p1: TechMeme multi-source editorial convergence (+200% on 'sources' tag)

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.65 | **Sources:** 1

TechMeme's 36 signals include 6 tagged 'sources', the only velocity metric with a non-trivial base count (1→3). TechMeme editors surface stories with multiple independent citations — an increase in multi-source stories signals genuine cross-outlet editorial convergence on something in the tech news cycle. Without drilling into the specific stories, this is a meta-signal that something warranted coordinated coverage this cycle. Action: inspect TechMeme's multi-source stories to identify what drove editorial convergence — that's likely the most reliable p1 content signal in this otherwise data-sparse cycle.

## p1: Safety and alignment discourse absent across all active sources

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.6

Zero explicit safety, alignment, or governance signals from any of the 8 reporting sources during a period of accelerating agent deployment. This absence is difficult to interpret with expert sources offline — Import AI and Ahead of AI are the primary safety-discourse carriers and both returned nothing this cycle. The absence could be genuine narrative fatigue, migration to policy-only venues, or simply a feed-health artifact. Action: flag for monitoring — if safety discourse remains absent after expert feeds are restored, that's a genuine p0 narrative-death signal worth escalating.

## p1: HuggingFace Papers sole research window — arXiv scraper absent

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.6 | **Sources:** 1

With arXiv returning zero signals, HuggingFace Papers (50 signals) is the only view into trending academic work. HuggingFace filters by community popularity (upvotes, downloads), not research significance — meaning niche but important papers (theory, safety proofs, negative results) are systematically underrepresented. The 'learning' subtopic (5 signals) suggests training methodology remains the community's focus over inference optimization or deployment. Action: treat research signals this cycle as crowd-popularity-filtered, not comprehensive; restore arXiv feed for balanced academic coverage.

## p2: LocalLLaMA in deployment/troubleshooting phase, not discovery phase

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.55 | **Sources:** 1

LocalLLaMA's 53 signals are dominated by 'resources' (15) and 'question/help' (13) rather than model-release excitement. The self-hosted LLM community has shifted from 'which model is best' to 'how do I run this reliably' — a maturation signal consistent with Qwen 2.5, Llama 3, and Gemma 2 reaching production-usable quality. This is a lagging indicator of the open-weight ecosystem crossing from evaluation to deployment. Action: for anyone building local-inference tooling, the demand signal is now operational support (quantization, memory management, serving) not model selection.

## p2: MarkTechPost covering Google research specifically

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.5 | **Sources:** 1

Both MarkTechPost signals tagged 'google', suggesting Google AI research is generating accessible expert coverage even while the Google Research primary feed is absent. MarkTechPost functions as an expert-tier proxy for primary-tier Google output. With the Google Research feed offline, this may be the only curated window into Google's research activity this cycle. Action: no immediate action, but note the dependency — if MarkTechPost also goes offline, Google research coverage drops to zero.

## p2: OpenAI primary feed at minimum output — 2 signals

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.45 | **Sources:** 1

OpenAI News produced 2 signals ('announcements', 'advancing'). Low primary-source output from OpenAI typically precedes major launches (GPT-5 cycle, new product lines) or reflects a genuine pause between release cycles. Without expert-tier commentary to contextualize, this is ambiguous. Action: establish as baseline; revisit if expert sources return with OpenAI-focused analysis that suggests pre-announcement quiet.
