## p0: Safety/alignment discourse absent during capabilities surge

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.78 | **Sources:** 5

Zero safety, alignment, or AI governance signals across all five source tiers this cycle — while singularity narrative surges +150% and MachineLearning research spikes +400%. When capabilities excitement runs hot and safety discourse vanishes, it historically precedes either a safety incident or a regulatory response. Monitor MIRI, ARC, and Anthropic safety team outputs for whether this silence reflects a genuine lull or a publishing lag.

## p0: Primary lab silence — OpenAI, Google Research, BAIR publishing nothing

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.72 | **Sources:** 4

All three primary-tier sources produced zero signals this cycle. OpenAI, Google Research, and BAIR going simultaneously quiet is unusual — last time this happened was pre-launch sequencing before major releases. Meanwhile the crowd tier (LocalLLaMA, r/OpenAI) is highly active with 'new model' appearing as a velocity signal. This pattern of lab silence + community speculation typically precedes announcements within 1-2 weeks. Track official blogs and pre-print servers for coordinated drops.

## p1: LocalLLaMA community dominance — 15 signals, help-oriented

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.75 | **Sources:** 1

LocalLLaMA produced 15 signals this cycle — more than any other single source — with 'question/help' (6) and 'discussion' (4) dominating over 'news'. This is a practitioner community actively deploying and troubleshooting local models, not just discussing them. The help-to-news ratio suggests the open-weight ecosystem has moved past 'check out this new model' into 'how do I make this work in production.' If you're building tooling or infrastructure, this community's pain points are your product roadmap.

## p1: MachineLearning subreddit research activity spike (+400%)

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.68 | **Sources:** 1

r/MachineLearning jumped from 1 to 5 signals with 'research' and 'project' tags dominating — a 400% velocity increase. This is the academic-practitioner community, not the hype communities. When this specific subreddit surges on 'research' tags while industry blogs are quiet, it usually means pre-prints are circulating that haven't been press-released yet. Check arXiv cs.LG and cs.CL new submissions from the past 48 hours for papers getting unusual early attention.

## p1: Editor tier doing personality profiles while crowd tier goes deep technical

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.65 | **Sources:** 3

TechMeme's 4 signals are tagged business/profile — likely personality-driven features on industry figures (velocity signals 'neil', 'shen', 'profile' suggest a venture/leadership profile, possibly Neil Shen of HongShan/ex-Sequoia China). Meanwhile Reddit and HN are overwhelmingly technical: LocalLLaMA leads with 15 signals on implementation questions. When editor tier covers people and crowd tier covers technology, it means the business narrative is lagging the technical reality. Look for the specific technical threads that editors haven't picked up yet.

## p1: Expert tier near-silence — only Simon Willison active

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.62 | **Sources:** 3

Of all expert-tier sources (Willison, Import AI, AlphaSignal, Last Week in AI, Ahead of AI, MarkTechPost), only Willison produced a signal — and it was tools/open-source focused, not research. When expert curators go quiet simultaneously while crowd communities surge, it typically means either: (a) experts are between publishing cycles, or (b) they're waiting to see how something plays out before committing analysis. Cross-reference with the primary lab silence — experts may be holding commentary until announcements land.

## p2: Simon Willison — LLM tooling and open-source focus

**Type:** consensus | **Confidence:** 0.58 | **Sources:** 1

Willison's sole signal this cycle is LLM tools + open-source. As the only active expert voice, his focus area becomes a weak directional signal. Willison has historically been early on developer tooling trends (datasette, sqlite-utils, llm CLI). His continued focus on open-source LLM tooling rather than proprietary APIs or research papers suggests the practical developer ecosystem is where the near-term action is. Aligns with LocalLLaMA's help-oriented surge.

## p2: No infrastructure, compute, or cost signals anywhere

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.55 | **Sources:** 4

Zero signals about GPU availability, training costs, inference pricing, cloud capacity, or hardware across all tiers. Given that Blackwell is shipping and inference cost is a key competitive dimension, this absence is notable. Either infrastructure has become 'solved enough' that it's no longer generating discussion, or the current news cycle is purely capabilities-focused. If you're making infrastructure investment decisions, the absence of discourse doesn't mean absence of change — it may mean the changes are happening inside enterprises without public discussion.

## p2: Singularity narrative resurgence — r/singularity +150%

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.5 | **Sources:** 1

r/singularity jumped from 4 to 10 signals with robotics (2) and AI (3) as subtopics. This community's activity level is a sentiment barometer for AGI-timeline discourse. The +150% spike coinciding with primary lab silence and 'new model' velocity could mean the community is anticipating a capabilities milestone. On its own this is crowd noise, but if editor or expert tiers pick up AGI-timeline framing next cycle, it becomes a narrative shift signal.

## p2: Neuroscience cross-pollination appearing in AI feeds

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.42 | **Sources:** 1

Neuroscience appeared as a new velocity signal (+100% from 0→1). While a single signal is weak, neuroscience topics appearing in AI-focused feeds is a cross-domain marker worth tracking. The neuro-AI intersection has been producing actionable results — brain-inspired architectures, cognitive benchmarks, neural scaling laws. If this signal persists or appears in expert-tier sources next cycle, it could indicate a new research direction gaining traction. Watch for specific papers bridging computational neuroscience and transformer architectures.
