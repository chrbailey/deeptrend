## p0: Multi-agent systems research absent despite agent industry boom

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.82 | **Sources:** 2

cs.MA has exactly 1 arXiv signal despite 'agentic AI' dominating industry narrative and multiple agent SDKs shipping in 2025 (OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK, LangGraph). Academic multi-agent research isn't tracking industry product activity — current agent frameworks are engineering integrations, not research breakthroughs. If you're evaluating agent architectures, look at the PL and systems literature rather than cs.MA; the real work is happening in tooling repos, not research papers.

## p0: AI safety/alignment discourse invisible during active EU AI Act enforcement

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.76 | **Sources:** 3

Zero cs.CY (computers & society) signals across all feeds, no safety-specific topics from any source, despite EU AI Act prohibited practices provisions being actively enforced since Feb 2025 and broader obligations phasing in now. Safety discourse has either migrated entirely to private governance channels and compliance consultancies, or genuinely cooled during a capabilities-dominated period. Check whether your safety-adjacent colleagues have pivoted to compliance work — the research-to-regulation pipeline may have absorbed the talent.

## p1: OpenAI content volume creates systematic noise in feed-based intelligence

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.88 | **Sources:** 1

OpenAI News (205 signals from a single source) produces more raw volume than arXiv's entire 15-category output (50 signals). This isn't proportional to research output — it reflects a content marketing strategy that floods feed-based discovery systems. Their 'learning' tag (16 signals) confirms tutorial/educational content inflating counts. Any intelligence pipeline consuming these feeds uncritically will be OpenAI-narrative-biased by default. Normalize by source before aggregating, or cap per-source signal counts.

## p1: Google Research output is 92% non-model work while OpenAI is 100% announcements

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.8 | **Sources:** 2

Of 100 Google Research signals, only 8 relate to models — the rest is applied science, infrastructure, and domain research. Meanwhile OpenAI's 205 signals are almost entirely announcements and educational content ('learning': 16 signals). These two primary-tier sources have diverged into completely different content strategies: Google is publishing research breadth, OpenAI is publishing marketing depth. If you're tracking frontier model competition, neither research blog is the right signal source anymore — watch product launches and benchmark results directly.

## p1: Computer vision maintains research parity with NLP despite 'language model era' framing

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.78 | **Sources:** 1

cs.CV (8 signals) nearly matches cs.CL (11) on arXiv, and cs.CV cross-lists with cs.AI at a higher rate (6/8 = 75%) than cs.CL does (5/11 = 45%). Vision research is more deeply integrated with general AI work than language research is. The multimodal thesis is playing out in research activity patterns, not just product announcements. Researchers focused purely on text modalities are missing where roughly a third of frontier work is happening.

## p1: cs.PL × cs.AI × cs.CR: formal verification entering AI security

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.65 | **Sources:** 1

Programming languages researchers crossing into AI + cryptography/security is a non-obvious arXiv intersection appearing in this cycle. PL techniques — type systems, formal verification, proof assistants — being applied to AI security suggests 'provably safe AI' is transitioning from theoretical interest to active research programs. If you work on AI deployment in regulated environments, track cs.PL venues (PLDI, POPL); they may produce the verification frameworks that EU AI Act compliance will eventually require.

## p2: Velocity scoring pipeline producing numeric ID artifacts instead of topic signals

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.93 | **Sources:** 1

All 10 'hot topics' are numeric strings (225, 229, 230, 233, 234, 300, 330, 334, 335, 427) with trivial 0→1 signal transitions. These are internal identifiers leaking into topic extraction, not meaningful velocity signals. The velocity detection system is generating false positives and masking genuine acceleration patterns. Pipeline fix: verify that topic slugs are extracted from signal content/metadata before velocity calculations, not from source_ids or row numbers.

## p2: Reddit communities in discussion-heavy consolidation phase

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.72 | **Sources:** 1

r/MachineLearning shows 14 discussion vs 9 research signals; r/LocalLLaMA has 8 discussion vs 3 news; r/OpenAI has 11 discussion vs 4 questions. High discussion-to-discovery ratios across all ML subreddits indicate crowd-tier sources are digesting existing developments, not surfacing new ones. This is characteristic of a plateau between disruptions — the last major shock has been absorbed and communities are waiting for the next inflection. Reduce weight on crowd-tier signals during consolidation phases; they'll echo existing narratives rather than discover new ones.

## p2: Hardware and compute economics absent from all feed tiers

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.7 | **Sources:** 3

Zero signals about custom silicon, chip supply chains, training cost economics, or compute infrastructure despite these being active industry storylines (NVIDIA earnings cycles, custom accelerator deployments, DeepSeek's cost-efficiency narrative still reverberating). The curated feed sources have a blind spot here — hardware/infrastructure discussion lives in earnings calls, semiconductor trade press, and private Slack channels that no RSS feed captures. Researchers making infrastructure or self-hosting decisions need a dedicated hardware intelligence source.

## p2: Game-theoretic AI (cs.GT × cs.AI) has single signal despite agent deployment scaling

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.58 | **Sources:** 1

Only 1 cs.GT × cs.AI signal despite game theory being foundational to multi-agent coordination, mechanism design for AI marketplaces, and competitive agent negotiation. As deployed agents begin transacting with each other through MCP and similar protocols, game-theoretic analysis of agent interactions becomes critical. This is likely underrepresented in feeds rather than underresearched — check AAAI, EC (Economics & Computation), and NeurIPS workshop proceedings directly for this thread.
