## p0: Safety/alignment still absent — second consecutive cycle confirms pattern

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.78 | **Sources:** 5

Previous cycle flagged safety research absence as p0. This cycle: still zero safety-specific signals across all active sources. With BAIR dark, expert newsletters absent, and no safety-tagged arXiv papers surfacing, this is now a confirmed two-cycle pattern, not a sampling artifact. The field is producing capabilities discussion (agents, models, tooling) with no visible safety counterweight in any trust tier. Senior researchers should note: if you're working on safety/alignment, your work isn't reaching any of these 14+ distribution channels.

## p1: HuggingFace Papers, BAIR, OpenAI News — primary and crowd academic sources all dark

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.88 | **Sources:** 3

Zero signals from HuggingFace Papers (crowd), BAIR (primary), and OpenAI News (primary). Combined with the expert absences, this cycle is running on Reddit, HN, TechMeme, Google Trends, and two expert blogs. The 'primary' trust tier has zero representation. Any analysis claiming cross-tier convergence this cycle is operating on 3 of 7 trust tiers (raw, crowd, editor) plus a sliver of expert. This isn't an insight about AI — it's a data quality warning that downgrades everything else.

## p1: Expert-tier coverage collapse — 4 of 6 sources absent second consecutive cycle

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.85 | **Sources:** 2

Import AI, AlphaSignal, Last Week in AI, and Ahead of AI produced zero signals again. If this persists from the previous cycle, it's no longer a timing artifact — it means deeptrend's expert tier is structurally degraded. The entire 'expert' signal this cycle is 3 Simon Willison posts (tools-focused) and 1 MarkTechPost summary (Google-focused). Any convergence score involving 'expert' tier is unreliable until at least 2 of these 4 sources repopulate. Action: check whether these RSS feeds are returning 304/empty or whether the newsletters genuinely skipped a cycle.

## p1: Google Trends volume anomaly — 107 signals but zero specificity

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.82 | **Sources:** 1

Google Trends produced 107 signals (43% of all signals this cycle) tagged only as 'trending' with no subtopic differentiation. This source is adding volume without information. 107 undifferentiated trend signals inflate the total count and could mislead velocity calculations. Action: consider whether Google Trends needs subtopic extraction or whether it should be downweighted in signal counts until the scraper can extract actual search terms rather than just flagging things as 'trending'.

## p1: GitHub Trending, arXiv, HuggingFace Papers — algorithm and academic tiers absent this cycle

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.8 | **Sources:** 3

No signals from GitHub Trending, arXiv, or HuggingFace Papers in this panel. Last cycle surfaced cross-domain arXiv papers (HEP-ex × cs.LG, physics.ao-ph × cs.LG, cs.GT × cs.AI × cs.MA) and an unknown GitHub project. Their absence removes the only sources capable of surfacing novel research and emerging tools before the newsletter cycle. Without these, this analysis is limited to what people are talking about (Reddit, HN) and what editors chose to cover (TechMeme) — no view into what's being built or researched.

## p1: LocalLLaMA dominates Reddit AI discussion — 30 of 85 signals

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.72 | **Sources:** 2

r/LocalLLaMA produced 30 signals (35% of all Reddit), outpacing r/OpenAI (20), r/singularity (19), and r/artificial (9). 'Resources' subtopic surged +250%. The local/open-source inference community is the most active Reddit AI community by volume, and they're sharing resources (models, configs, benchmarks) not just discussing. This aligns with Simon Willison's exclusive tooling focus — the practitioner community is in 'building mode' not 'watching mode'. If you're in the open-weight model ecosystem, the distribution channel is r/LocalLLaMA + Willison, not mainstream press.

## p1: TechMeme's 38 signals heavy on funding rounds — 'raised' appears in 5 of 38

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.65 | **Sources:** 2

13% of TechMeme editor-tier coverage is funding announcements ('raised' tag). TechMeme's editorial curation reflects what mainstream tech business considers important. When funding rounds make up a significant slice of AI coverage, it signals the narrative is in a 'money moving' phase rather than a 'technology shipping' phase. Cross-reference: Reddit's AI communities are in building mode (resources +250%), while the business press covers capital allocation. This editor-vs-crowd divergence suggests the money narrative and the builder narrative have decoupled.

## p2: HN developer signal surge — +133% velocity with 16 signals

**Type:** trend | **Confidence:** 0.62 | **Sources:** 1

HN Digest jumped from 3 to 7 signals (before dedup) with +133% velocity. The topics are diverse (developer tools, garment, notation, language) rather than concentrated on a single narrative. When developer community volume surges but disperses across unrelated topics, it typically means no single AI story is dominating — the community is in exploration mode rather than reacting to a major event. This is consistent with the broader pattern: no major product launch or research breakthrough is driving this cycle.

## p2: Garment/fashion + formal notation appearing in HN Digest — non-AI topics breaking through

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.6 | **Sources:** 1

HN Digest shows +100% velocity on 'garment', 'formal', 'notation', 'descriptive', and 'warren' — none of these are AI topics. When developer community attention shifts toward non-AI subjects (fashion tech, formal methods, Warren Buffett?), it may signal AI fatigue in the HN crowd tier. Compare with previous cycles: if HN was predominantly AI-focused and is now diversifying, the developer community's AI attention may be fragmenting. For AI product builders targeting developers, this means you're competing with a broader attention landscape than 6 months ago.

## p2: MarkTechPost's single signal tagged 'google' — expert tier aligning with Google narrative

**Type:** divergence | **Confidence:** 0.55 | **Sources:** 2

MarkTechPost's only signal this cycle covers Google research. Combined with Google Research's own teaching-focused signal from last cycle, Google has a quiet but present cross-tier footprint (expert + primary) while OpenAI's footprint is entirely Reddit-driven (raw tier only). For competitive intelligence: Google is maintaining expert-tier mindshare through research coverage even when their own blog is quiet. OpenAI's volume is louder but shallower in tier diversity.
